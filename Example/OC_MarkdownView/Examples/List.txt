You can make an unordered list by preceding one or more lines of text with `-`, `*`, or `+`.

```
- George Washington
- John Adams
- Thomas Jefferson
```

- George Washington
- John Adams
- Thomas Jefferson

To order your list, precede each line with a number.

```
1. James Madison
2. James Monroe
3. John Quincy Adams
```

1. James Madison
2. James Monroe
3. John Quincy Adams

## Nested Lists

You can create a nested list by indenting one or more list items below another item.

```
1. First list item
   - First nested list item
     - Second nested list item
```

1. First list item
   - First nested list item
     - Second nested list item

## Task lists

To create a task list, preface list items with a hyphen and space followed by [ ].
To mark a task as complete, use [x].

Note that the `DocC` theme doesn't have a task list marker style and uses simple
bullets.
